- Display a 8-day forecast with temperature highs and lows for each day.
- Implement pull-to-refresh functionality to update the weather data.
- Handle errors gracefully and display appropriate error messages if the API request fails or location permission is denied.
- Implement unit tests to ensure the accuracy of the weather data parsing and other critical functions.
- Utilize appropriate state management techniques Riverpod to manage the app's state effectively.
- Create a visually appealing UI design that follows Flutter's design guidelines and provides a seamless user experience.
- Optimize app performance and ensure smooth scrolling and transitions between screens.
- Implement proper error handling and use appropriate loading indicators during data fetching.
- Bonus Points (Optional):
